After cloning `redis-stack-website`, run `make docker` to build and run a container that serves hugo on `localhost:1313` with the components defined in `redis_stack_components.yml`.
The site is generated inside the container.
In order to invoke a short-loop of changes, it's possible to `make docker-sh VOL=/home/repos` (replace `/home/repos` with your repo directory), which will run the container (assuming you've already generated it).
At this point it is possible to modify `redis_stack_components.yml` within the container with location of repos  (e.g. `git_path: /home/repos/RedisJSON`) - do not forget to remark-out `git_url`.
At this stage, from within the container run `make build`.
This will generate the site based on your local repo changes.
`make up` will bring up hugo so it is possible to examine the site from your host's browser.
